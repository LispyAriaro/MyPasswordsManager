Most times we forget the login details for a website. With this Google Chrome extension, you can save the email, 
username and/ or password you used to signup on that website for later retrieval. This is better than having a 
folder or text file on your computer where you save the login details for the many websites you visit ... which I used
to do. I made this for myself and decided to share. It may be the dumbest thing you have ever used. 

To install this extension simply extract the contents to some directory. 
Go the Google chrome ... 
Select Settings ... 
Click on Extensions ... 
make sure to check 'developer mode'
Click the 'Load unpacked extension' button

A file/folder chooser popup will appear. Select the MyPasswordsManager folder. And that's it.
